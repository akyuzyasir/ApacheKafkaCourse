    // Kafka vs Traditional Systems
    /*
        *Design and Use Cases
            - Traditional messaging systems are designed for low-frequency messaging, where messages are sent infrequently.
            - Kafka is designed for high-frequency messaging, where messages are sent at a high rate.
            - Kafka's ability to cope with real-time data streams is better than traditional messaging systems.

        * Distribution Model ( Kafka - pull / RabbitMQ - push)
            - Kafka uses a pull-based distribution model, where consumers pull data from the broker. However, RabbitMQ uses a push-based distribution model, where the broker pushes data to consumers. 
            - Kafka's pull-based model allows consumers to control the rate at which they consume data, making it more flexible than RabbitMQ's push-based model.
        * Message Persistence Mechanism
            - Kafka stores messages on disk, which allows it to retain messages for a longer period of time. In contrast, RabbitMQ stores messages in memory, which limits the amount of data that can be stored. 
        * Performance and Scalability
            - Kafka is designed for high throughput and low latency, making it suitable for large-scale applications. RabbitMQ is better suited for low-frequency messaging, where performance and scalability are not critical.
        * Community and Ecosystem
            - Kafka has a large and active community, with many third-party tools and libraries available. So, it is easy to integrate Kafka with other systems and tools.
