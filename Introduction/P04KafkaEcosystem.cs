        * Kafka Connect
            - Kafka Connect is a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems such as databases, storage systems, and messaging systems. It allows you to import data into Kafka and export data from Kafka using connectors.
        * Kafka Streams
            - Kafka Streams is a client library for building real-time stream processing applications on top of Kafka. It allows you to process data streams in real-time and build applications that can transform, aggregate, and join data streams.
        * Kafka REST Proxy
            - Kafka REST Proxy is a RESTful interface for interacting with Kafka. It allows you to produce and consume messages from Kafka using HTTP requests, making it easy to integrate Kafka with web applications and other systems.
        * Schema Registry
            - Schema Registry is a service for managing Avro schemas in Kafka. It allows you to store and retrieve Avro schemas and ensure that producers and consumers use compatible schemas when producing and consuming messages.
        * Kafka Monitoring Tools
            - There are many monitoring tools available for Kafka, such as Confluent Control Center, Burrow, and Kafka Manager. These tools allow you to monitor the health and performance of your Kafka cluster and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
        * Kafka Security
            - Kafka provides security features such as SSL/TLS encryption, authentication, and authorization to secure your Kafka cluster. You can configure Kafka to use these security features to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access.
        * Kafka Clients
            - Kafka provides clients for various programming languages such as Java, Python, Go, and C/C++. These clients allow you to produce and consume messages from Kafka and build applications that interact with Kafka.
        * Kafka Connectors
            - Kafka provides connectors for integrating with external systems such as JDBC, Elasticsearch, HDFS, and Amazon S3. These connectors allow you to import data into Kafka and export data from Kafka to other systems.
        * Kafka Plugins
            - Kafka supports plugins for extending its functionality. You can write custom plugins to add new features to Kafka, such as custom serializers, deserializers, and interceptors.
