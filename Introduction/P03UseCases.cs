    /* // Typical Use Case
            * Messaging
                - Kafka can also be used as traditional message broker. But since initial code complexity is more than message brokers like RabbitMQ, it is better to use those brokers in low-frequency, low-volume applications.
            * Log Aggregation
                - Kafka can be used to collect logs from multiple sources and store them in a central location. This allows for easy analysis and monitoring of logs. Since Kafka is distributed and fault-tolerant, it can handle large volumes of log data.
            * Application activity tracking
                - Kafka can be used to track user activity in real-time. This can be useful for monitoring user behavior, analyzing user interactions, and generating real-time reports. Theese activities can range from simple page views to complex user interactions such as clicks, searches, and purchases.
            * Real-time data processing
                - Kafka can be used to process real-time data streams. This can be useful for applications that require real-time processing of data, such as fraud detection, real-time analytics, and monitoring of IoT devices.
            * Microservice Design Patterns (Event sourcing)
                - Kafka can be used to implement event sourcing in microservices architecture. Event sourcing is a design pattern where the state of an application is determined by a sequence of events. Kafka can be used to store these events and replay them to rebuild the state of the application.
