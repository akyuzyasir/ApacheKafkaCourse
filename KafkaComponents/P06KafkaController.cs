    /*
        Each cluster has one broker that acts as the controller. The controller is responsible for managing the state of the cluster, including electing leaders for partitions, reassigning partitions between brokers, and handling failover scenarios. The controller maintains the metadata of the cluster, such as the list of brokers, topics, and partitions, and ensures that the cluster is in a consistent state. If the controller fails, another broker is elected as the new controller to take over its responsibilities. The controller communicates with ZooKeeper to maintain the metadata of the cluster and coordinate actions between brokers. The controller is a critical component of the Kafka cluster and plays a key role in ensuring the reliability and availability of the system.
